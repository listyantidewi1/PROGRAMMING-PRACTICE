Questions:

Which predictions, if any, proved incorrect as you increased the number of simulations?: TODO

Less than 10 simulations are proven incorrect as I increased the number of simulations

Suppose you're charged a fee for each second of compute time your program uses.
After how many simulations would you call the predictions "good enough"?: TODO

After 150 simulations I would call the predictions "good enough"
