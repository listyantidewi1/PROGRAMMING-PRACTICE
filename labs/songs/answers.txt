Spotify Wrapped is a feature presenting Spotify users’ 100 most played songs from the past year. In 2021, Spotify Wrapped calculated an “Audio Aura” for each user, a “reading of [their] two most prominent moods as dictated by [their] top songs and artists of the year.” Suppose Spotify determines an audio aura by looking at the average energy, valence, and danceability of a person’s top 100 songs from the past year. In answers.txt, reflect on the following questions:

If songs.db contains the top 100 songs of one listener from 2018, how would you characterize their audio aura?
I'd characterize their audio aura by averaging the energy, valence, and danceability of the top 25 played songs out of 100 top songs


Hypothesize about why the way you’ve calculated this aura might not be very representative of the listener. What better ways of calculating this aura would you propose?
It might not be very representative because some listener might stick to 1-3 songs that will contribute to bias in the calculated average value (of energy, danceability, and valence). I would propose to add weight to each song according to how much it's played by the listener. The weight would be calculated based on how many and how long a particular song is played and whether the user liked, favorited, rated, or add the song in their repeteadly played playlist compared to the other top 25 songs. The weight then added to the aggregated value of energy, danceability, and valence.
